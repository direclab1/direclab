        ## About DiReC Lab

        The Digital Innovation and Research in Construction (DiReC) Lab advances data-driven and AI-enabled models to improve work processes, efficiency, and sustainability across the built environment. Our research focuses on leveraging digital data and intelligent technologies to enhance decision-making throughout the project and asset life cycle. Despite the rapid digital transformation across other industries, construction continues to face challenges in fully harnessing the vast and growing data generated from projects, organizations, and industry systems. DiReC addresses this gap by combining artificial intelligence, machine learning, simulation, and data analytics to extract actionable insights from complex and heterogeneous data sources. Our team collaborates closely with industry partners to ensure our research is grounded in real-world challenges and produces practical, scalable impacts. Through interdisciplinary research and strong industry collaboration, DiReC aims to transform construction practices with intelligent, evidence-based, and socially responsible innovation.

        ## Current Research Areas

        **AI and data analytics for project intelligence:** This research leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract critical clauses and risks from complex contracts and technical specifications. By synthesizing historical project data, these systems provide predictive insights that enable project managers to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation in real-time.

        **Data interoperability for asset intensive industries:** The focus is on dismantling information silos by implementing unified frameworks that facilitate seamless data exchange across the entire asset lifecycle. This ensures that Digital Twins and Building Information Models (BIM) remain consistent and actionable for all stakeholders, from initial design through to long-term decommissioning.

        **Workforce development and productivity solutions:** This initiative investigates the integration of human-centric technologies, such as wearable sensors and collaborative robotics, to augment the physical capabilities of the existing workforce. Furthermore, it explores strategic recruitment and retention models designed to bridge the skills gap and enhance per-capita productivity on increasingly complex job sites.

        **Innovative games and simulations for construction education and training:** By utilizing high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) and "serious games," we create immersive environments where learners can practice high-stakes decision-making in a risk-free setting. This approach transforms abstract management theories into visceral experiences, significantly improving knowledge retention and preparing the next generation for real-world field challenges.
