            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Understanding and estimating realistic production rates of major work items in a highway project are critical to determining a reasonable project contract time, evaluating the contractor's baseline schedule, monitoring progress schedules, and ultimately completing the project on time. This project will leverage Texas DOT's historical project data to extract the as-built information of production rates of various work items, and develop an interactive tool that can generate color-coded heat maps to visualize feasible ranges of production rates of major work items across Texas. An advanced and interactive production rate estimation tool could significantly help Texas DOT achieve the goal of completing highway projects on time. Such a decision-aid tool could significantly improve Texas DOT's practice in determining more accurate production rates, resulting in more accurate contract time determination, the contractor's baseline schedule evaluation, and progress schedule monitoring. Such data-driven and practical production rates may provide higher certainty and reliability than the Texas DOT's current construction production rates table.

            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Change orders are the main reason for project delay and cost overrun. The most common reason for change orders in highway projects is "work item omission in contract" which accounts for more than two third of change orders. Identification of missing work items before bid advertisement will significantly help reduce the number of change orders during construction and it will help determining a realistic project budget. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) can serve as a key technique for the systematic identification of potentially missing work items in a new project by analyzing the space of historical project data. Specifically, as a sub-field of cutting-edge AI techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables a computer to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and computational way. Innovative NLP techniques will contribute to the automated and reliable identification of potential change order items due to missing work items.

            • Funding Agency: T3 Grant - Texas A&M University.<br>
            • Objective: The construction industry is one of the largest industry sectors in the U.S. and globally. However, compared with the other industry sectors, the construction industry has failed to improve the productivity over the last fifty years. There is no lack of evidence that the main causes of this failure are poor construction project management and organizational issues. Effective construction project management theories and principles have evolved over time and they are taught in academia and in industry in traditional settings. However, those theories and principles are inherently highly soft and intangible concepts that affect the entire project life cycle involving a large size of workflows, and interactions between project participants. The current and traditional teaching and learning models are not effective for students and trainees to truly understand and learn actional knowledge for change in the construction industry. One of the most successful ways to impart actional knowledge of those soft theories and principles are through serious games and participatory simulations. These often take the form of low-risk, small-scale controlled experiments that help students determine the impact of a decision before scaling a proposed process up to a full project; and create an enjoyable and effective lesson by imparting an "aha moment" to stakeholders. This project will develop virtual participatory simulation games for teaching and learning construction project management theories and principles and test the efficacy and value as an alternate to existing teaching and learning methods. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new business environment where most training and education sessions must be delivered in a virtual setting. Thus, this research topic is timely since the ultimate goal is to test and develop the most efficient education and training approach for construction project management theories and principles in a virtual environment.

            • Objective: This project is to develop an on-line, collaborative, virtual simulation games for rapid dissemination of lean design and construction principles, methods and tools to the construction industry Developing virtual lean simulation games is challenging because the games should be dynamic, fun, and interactive to ensure the same or preferably higher level of participation and engagement of the participants as with the in-person games, and more importantly, the same or higher level of learning through virtual settings compared with in-person settings. We will test and hone our proof-of-concept simulation on volunteer practitioners using feedback from pre- and post- simulation surveys and develop an implementation strategy for industry. This research initiative will ultimately contribute to improving construction productivity and efficiency of construction projects.

            • Sponsor: Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB).<br>
            • Objectives: This research project developed a data driven Granular Roadway Asset Management System (GRAMS) to assist local agencies in making more reliable gravel loss estimation and consequently determining annual rock requirements for proper budgeting purposes. In this study, a series of online and in-person meetings and interviews were conducted along with electronic mailing surveys to gather information to develop a user-friendly GRAMS. Advanced statistical analysis methods such as the beta regression model and survival analysis were used as computational algorithms for estimation and risk analysis. When the user enters several input values, the GRAMS can generate a range of estimates under varying budget conditions and different levels of service. The tool is expected to significantly help local agencies to obtain consistency in terms of estimating gravel loss and determining rock requirement and as a result, better defend their granular road maintenance budget requests and management. This tool is primarily based upon empirical data and further calibration is recommended for enhanced estimation.

            • Objectives: In the United States, traffic volumes and congestion are projected to continue increasing, though limited growth is expected in roadway capacity. Consequently, transportation agencies are increasingly focused on maintaining and extending the lifespan of the transportation infrastructure. To this end, it is imperative that construction and maintenance activities can be conducted in a manner that optimizes safety while maintaining acceptable levels of mobility. This project will focus on further improvement areas of additional guidance, training opportunities, and decision support tools for highway work zone safety. Key topics include Post Project Construction Evaluation, Work Near Signalized/Unsignalized Intersections, Traffic Management/Safety During Winter Construction and Severe Weather, Low-Cost Work Zone Management Strategies, and Development and Application of Work Zone Crash Modification Factor. Based on research findings, a series of training materials will be developed.

            • Objectives: Industrial capital projects are risky business ventures. As they increase in size, uncertainty, and complexity, they frequently experience corresponding growth in cost and time to deliver, and they often fail to achieve their desired performance results. The risk-shedding structure of current project delivery methods not only creates a non-collaborative environment that impedes the performance of industrial projects; risk-shedding can also stifle innovation and create inefficiencies during industrial project delivery processes. For decades, the delivery of industrial capital projects has suffered from stunted productivity growth and little broad industry innovation while seeing an increase in claims and disputes. Traditional project delivery has not proven to be reliable for industrial capital projects. The industry is open to alternatives. This research project evaluated the potential of increasing integration and collaboration by applying the principles of IPD and Alliancing in the industrial capital projects sector. The key findings from this project is that the increased integration and collaboration that come from implementing IPD and Alliancing principles can lead to better project performance and increase the probability of successfully achieving the business case objectives of an industrial project.

            • Objectives: Due to an array of advanced digital technologies, much of today's transportation project data are available in digital format. However, due to the fragmented nature of the highway project delivery process, the growing amount of digital data is being archived and managed separately. This makes it difficult for professionals to take full advantage of the efficiencies of digitized data and information. The purpose of this research was to identify current data workflows and areas for improvement for five of the most common types of highway assets—signs, guardrails, culverts, pavements, and bridges—and offer guidance to practitioners on how to better collect, manage, and exchange asset data. For each type of asset, an information delivery manual (IDM) was developed. Each IDM consists of several process maps (PMs) and one exchange requirement (ER) matrix. A total of 15 PMs and 5 ER matrices were developed. A set of limitations in current data workflows was identified and a set of recommendations to overcome those limitations was also determined and documented. The conclusion was that current data workflows were designed mostly for contract administration purposes. Thus, more efficient asset-centric data workflows need to be implemented to truly streamline the data workflows throughout an asset's life cycle and minimize wasted resources in recreating data in the asset maintenance stage.

            • Objectives: Pavement preservation has shown to improve pavement performance and the desire to maximize Iowa's infrastructure investment has led Iowa to invest in collecting pavement performance information. This data, combined with construction and contract records can provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of pavement preservation techniques on Iowa roadways. The overreaching objective of pavement preservation is to bolster the pavement network investment and maintain a higher level of service. This research aims to improve the understanding of pavement preservation strategies in Iowa by focusing on three key areas: (1) documenting the effectiveness using both qualitative and quantitative metrics (2) understanding the important factors that influence the performance of pavement preservation strategies and (3) develop guidance for selecting pavement preservation techniques considering cost and roadway characteristics such as traffic, pavement condition and construction history.

            • Objectives: The estimation of design efforts and costs plays a vital role in authorizing funds and controlling the budget during the project development process. Typically, the design phase consists of various engineering activities that require substantial efforts to deliver the final construction documents for bid preparation. Estimating these efforts accurately and efficiently is critical for transportation agencies in properly allocating funds, time, and resources. Therefore, there is a need for a proactive scheme to more accurately and reliably estimate design efforts and costs in order to help the design office negotiate more confidently with consulting firms and ultimately to enhance the accountability and transparency of funding decisions. In this Phase I study, historical data driven estimation models including regression models ad neural networks models were developed and tested. Also, a case-based reasoning–based tool was developed to make logical inferences when estimating the design efforts and costs of bridge design efforts. The case-based reasoning approach uses the concept of similarity scores to retrieve the records of the most similar historical bridge design projects. </p>
