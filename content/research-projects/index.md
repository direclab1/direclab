            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Understanding and estimating realistic production rates of major work items in a highway project are critical to determining a reasonable project contract time, evaluating the contractor's baseline schedule, monitoring progress schedules, and ultimately completing the project on time. This project will leverage Texas DOT's historical project data to extract the as-built information of production rates of various work items, and develop an interactive tool that can generate color-coded heat maps to visualize feasible ranges of production rates of major work items across Texas. An advanced and interactive production rate estimation tool could significantly help Texas DOT achieve the goal of completing highway projects on time. Such a decision-aid tool could significantly improve Texas DOT's practice in determining more accurate production rates, resulting in more accurate contract time determination, the contractor's baseline schedule evaluation, and progress schedule monitoring. Such data-driven and practical production rates may provide higher certainty and reliability than the Texas DOT's current construction production rates table.

            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Change orders are the main reason for project delay and cost overrun. The most common reason for change orders in highway projects is "work item omission in contract" which accounts for more than two third of change orders. Identification of missing work items before bid advertisement will significantly help reduce the number of change orders during construction and it will help determining a realistic project budget. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) can serve as a key technique for the systematic identification of potentially missing work items in a new project by analyzing the space of historical project data. Specifically, as a sub-field of cutting-edge AI techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables a computer to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and computational way. Innovative NLP techniques will contribute to the automated and reliable identification of potential change order items due to missing work items.

            • Funding Agency: T3 Grant - Texas A&M University.<br>
            • Objective: The construction industry is one of the largest industry sectors in the U.S. and globally. However, compared with the other industry sectors, the construction industry has failed to improve the productivity over the last fifty years. There is no lack of evidence that the main causes of this failure are poor construction project management and organizational issues. Effective construction project management theories and principles have evolved over time and they are taught in academia and in industry in traditional settings. However, those theories and principles are inherently highly soft and intangible concepts that affect the entire project life cycle involving a large size of workflows, and interactions between project participants. The current and traditional teaching and learning models are not effective for students and trainees to truly understand and learn actional knowledge for change in the construction industry. One of the most successful ways to impart actional knowledge of those soft theories and principles are through serious games and participatory simulations. These often take the form of low-risk, small-scale controlled experiments that help students determine the impact of a decision before scaling a proposed process up to a full project; and create an enjoyable and effective lesson by imparting an "aha moment" to stakeholders. This project will develop virtual participatory simulation games for teaching and learning construction project management theories and principles and test the efficacy and value as an alternate to existing teaching and learning methods. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new business environment where most training and education sessions must be delivered in a virtual setting. Thus, this research topic is timely since the ultimate goal is to test and develop the most efficient education and training approach for construction project management theories and principles in a virtual environment.

            • Objective: This project is to develop an on-line, collaborative, virtual simulation games for rapid dissemination of lean design and construction principles, methods and tools to the construction industry Developing virtual lean simulation games is challenging because the games should be dynamic, fun, and interactive to ensure the same or preferably higher level of participation and engagement of the participants as with the in-person games, and more importantly, the same or higher level of learning through virtual settings compared with in-person settings. We will test and hone our proof-of-concept simulation on volunteer practitioners using feedback from pre- and post- simulation surveys and develop an implementation strategy for industry. This research initiative will ultimately contribute to improving construction productivity and efficiency of construction projects.

            • Sponsor: Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB).<br>
            • Objectives: This research project developed a data driven Granular Roadway Asset Management System (GRAMS) to assist local agencies in making more reliable gravel loss estimation and consequently determining annual rock requirements for proper budgeting purposes. In this study, a series of online and in-person meetings and interviews were conducted along with electronic mailing surveys to gather information to develop a user-friendly GRAMS. Advanced statistical analysis methods such as the beta regression model and survival analysis were used as computational algorithms for estimation and risk analysis. When the user enters several input values, the GRAMS can generate a range of estimates under varying budget conditions and different levels of service. The tool is expected to significantly help local agencies to obtain consistency in terms of estimating gravel loss and determining rock requirement and as a result, better defend their granular road maintenance budget requests and management. This tool is primarily based upon empirical data and further calibration is recommended for enhanced estimation.
