            • Funding Agency: US Department of Labor.<br>
            • Objective: The lack of skilled workforce in the construction industry is getting worse and this shortage not only escalates project costs, delays, compromised quality and safety risks but also limits the industry's ability to meet growing demand, ultimately impacting the nation's economic growth and competitiveness. In response, the Department of Construction Science will create a worker-centered pathway for individuals who are interested in pursuing skilled, well-paying Construction Management careers in the renewable energy, transportation, and broadband sectors through this DOL sponsored grant. Strong support from the industry is a crucial element of the grant's success. This pioneering program will be offered at three locations (college station, Prairie view and McAllen) with collaboration with Prairie View A&M University.

            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Understanding and estimating realistic production rates of major work items in a highway project are critical to determining a reasonable project contract time, evaluating the contractor's baseline schedule, monitoring progress schedules, and ultimately completing the project on time. This project will leverage Texas DOT's historical project data to extract the as-built information of production rates of various work items, and develop an interactive tool that can generate color-coded heat maps to visualize feasible ranges of production rates of major work items across Texas. An advanced and interactive production rate estimation tool could significantly help Texas DOT achieve the goal of completing highway projects on time. Such a decision-aid tool could significantly improve Texas DOT's practice in determining more accurate production rates, resulting in more accurate contract time determination, the contractor's baseline schedule evaluation, and progress schedule monitoring. Such data-driven and practical production rates may provide higher certainty and reliability than the Texas DOT's current construction production rates table.

            • Objectives: This new NSF REU site focuses on emerging digital technologies and processes that are promising to transform construction into a safer, more productive, more resilient, and more sustainability cognizant sector. Undergraduate students in construction science and related disciplines have largely been neglected and underserved by research opportunities. Undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and women, from programs that lack research resources and opportunities will participate in the proposed summer research experience program, which will be reinforced with enrichment activities and professional development activities. Students will participate in highly innovative research projects sponsored by federal and state funding agencies, as well as industry sponsors. REU students will conduct research on virtual reality, 3D-printing, drones, digital twins, robotics, smart materials, energy simulation, machine learning and artificial intelligence in the context of construction innovation. The participating students will learn analytical skills, independent thinking and cognitive skills, and collaboration skills that are required for developing, testing, and validating emerging digital technologies and sustainable solutions for construction. This unique REU program will provide STEM-field undergraduate students another clear career path to construction through research and innovation.

            • Funding Agency: Texas Department of Transportation.<br>
            • Objective: Change orders are the main reason for project delay and cost overrun. The most common reason for change orders in highway projects is "work item omission in contract" which accounts for more than two third of change orders. Identification of missing work items before bid advertisement will significantly help reduce the number of change orders during construction and it will help determining a realistic project budget. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) can serve as a key technique for the systematic identification of potentially missing work items in a new project by analyzing the space of historical project data. Specifically, as a sub-field of cutting-edge AI techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables a computer to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and computational way. Innovative NLP techniques will contribute to the automated and reliable identification of potential change order items due to missing work items.
